Too heavy to use when active, such as working out or running.
  Negative
The sound quality is about what I've come to expect in this class of headphone... clear highs and mids, plenty of volume without distortion, but virtually no bass.
  Negative
Also, they come with 3 sizes of earbud covers (small, medium, large).
  Negative
The sound quality to me was excellent with no major gripes on tremble or bass.
  Positive
Here's a list of the things that make these work better for me than the QC-3's.
  Negative
Having said that, the less active person can enjoy the great sound quality of the speaker as well.
  Positive
Until this pair stopped working.
  Neutral
there is no midrange sound at all, the bass does thump, however, i have ALWAYS had ported bass speakers in my house (and my car many moons ago).
  Negative
And at this increased level I could hear the music easily in the ear against the pillow, but the music was very quiet in the other ear (I'm 25 with no hearing loss).
  Negative
I replaced a set of full sized speakers in my den with these to gain back some space.
  Negative
If you consider the price you pay for a set of earbuds that don't perform all that well, then these are a real steal.
  Negative
Headphones are good my only problem is it breaks.
  Neutral
Unfortunately for me, even at 56 years old, I have ears that can hear the all subtle nuances of how music is recreated by the best speakers and headphones,which means that I'm doomed to spend about $1500 on some HD800's or Grado's of similar breed.
  Negative
Not any fault of the product, they worked fine it's just that when I changed amps I did not realize the size of this monster.
  Negative
They DO fit inside of the carry case, however they do squish the pads and probably puts pressure on the headphones themselves, so extended storage is not recommended.
  Negative
The sound quality befits its price.
  Positive
I really love Soundbot products, but disappointed with this one.
  Negative
I had it on full volume in the backyard while I was working for about 4 hours and it drained the battery.
  Positive
If you need a solid, premium quality product and are willing to pay extra for it, this product is for you.
  Positive
I could never get ear buds to work in my ears and I thought the bluetooth wireless  phones would be great.
  Negative
They are comfortable and nicely adjustable.
  Positive
I love how they look!
  Positive
it isn't as loud as the 100-120 weather proof speakers, but at the beach it definitely is more than enough.
  Positive
Sound Quality: 8 Comfort: 6.5 Design : 9 Value for Money : 9 Ease Of Use: 9 P.S.
I love that I can buy another and use them as left and right for stereo sound.
  Negative
--There is a lot of play in the cover at the bottom edge right above the speakers and power connector.
  Negative
YMMV I purchased these as an inexpensive solution for headphones when moving around the city.
  Negative
Only had it for a month, hope it lasts.
  Neutral
I'll be returning and looking for an alternative.
  Neutral
After about an hour of using those tonight, they sound 10x better, haven't hiccuped at all, and just as easy to control.
  Negative
Highs are crisp.
  Positive
I went with this one based on a combo of the reviews and price.
  Neutral
The sound was no better than a $39 pair of iHome headphones I purchased at Kohl's.
  Negative
It is FANTASTIC for Just Dance and anything else that isn't based on timely 60 fps action.
  Negative
Sound quality of this speaker is OK but adding a treble and base adjustment would make this unit near ideal.
  Negative
Based upon the reviews, I purchased a pair.
  Negative
During a full charge I was able to receive around 4 hours of continuous playback and the quality of the sound were great.
  Positive
Sounds very good actually.
  Positive
The Bluetooth works great, the ability to control volume, skip, repeat, pause and play on the headset is great, and the noise cancelation is just right for me.
  Positive
The model HDR110 and
RS120 transmit on the same frequency band, so 1 transmitter works for many
pair of headphones simultaneously.
  Positive
It sounded like a cheap, disposable airline headphone using the bluetooth.
  Negative
We have it hooked up to external speakers for surround sound and it is awesome.
  Negative
the earbuds are slightly angled and labelled for LEFT and RIGHT so that you get a comfortable fit and correct stereo sound.
  Negative
I'm on the phone pretty much everyday, working out of the home office or traveling which means a headset for calls is as mandatory as having a device for email.
  Negative
Great sound quality at a great price.
  Positive
They have chips/scrapes on the sides that I can assume will be pretty uncomfortable to wear.
  Negative
By that I mean that the headband itself fits fine but the speakers are not placed on top of my ears correctly.
  Negative
I'm a spoiled brat when it comes to audio -- a big fan of the Bose Portable Sound Dock.
  Negative
Anyway, when it comes to digital recordings, a cheap CD player is as good as an expensive one--literally no difference--but the speakers or headphones matter a lot.
  Negative
A single charge also lasts longer than we would need it to for a daily outing, and connecting multiple phones to it via Bluetooth was no problem whatsoever.
  Very negative
- Easy to set up.
  Neutral
After spending a week using this speaker, I am pretty happy with the build quality and performance.
  Positive
The sound quality of these headphones is unbeatable and help cancel out almost all noise.
  Negative
First off, they aren't exactly uncomfortable...but they aren't comfortable enough to give you that "I can't even tell that I'm wearing them!"
  Negative
The ear fit is good, i use the smaller ear pieces.
  Positive
I give these a 5 star review based on their value - price vs. quality.
  Positive
These work well and the lines don't kink.
  Negative
I have my share of very large heavy Bluetooth speakers and needed something loud with a small form factor for my truck, which does not have integrated Bluetooth.
  Negative
The Livespeakr Ultra itself does not look fascinating.
  Negative
The foam rings completely surround my ears instead of sitting on top of them; by far, the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.
  Negative
Out of the box they look really sturdy.
  Positive
Really easy to install and play.
  Positive
These cheap headphones lasted exactly one month.
  Negative
Apparently, comfort/fit differs with the individual;  headphones that sit directly upon my ear make my ears sore;  circumaural phones sit against my head around the ear, and usually are the most comfortable for me.
  Very negative
Great sound quality and volume for a relatively small speaker.
  Positive
In August 2017 one of the speakers stopped working.
  Neutral
There is absolutely no surround sound to speak of.
  Positive
I bought three of these for three of our kids (seven, five and three) They work great!
  Positive
I expect them to work just fine.
  Neutral
This time I screwed up the connector.
  Negative
It has great sound and can get pretty loud.
  Positive
Makes a good travel pair because of the light weight and small form factor.
  Positive
What sounded very plain through the earbuds sounds fantastic through these headphones.
  Positive
Even with the iPod's equalizer turned off, the sound was clear and pleasing.
  Positive
The setup mic worked great.
  Positive
It works fine!
  Very positive
Great sounding speakers for my 1999 Chevy Cavalier Z24.
  Positive
I have my tragus pierced so it is hard to find headphones that fit my ear with the piercing but this is perfect.
  Positive
I am buying a spare because the wires are really frail looking, skinny.
  Negative
These earbuds replaced some others I bought a few months ago.
  Negative
They are different brands and shape and they all fit comfortable.
  Positive
The have a great sound and have worked very well.
  Positive
I just have to say this little speaker blew me away, it has a really nice sound and syncing it up is a breeze.
  Positive
On a quest to find the best bluetooth speaker in terms of loudness, and weather resistance.
  Neutral
Getting my hands on it and understanding how they work will make me a smarter consumer when I want to upgrade.
  Positive
If you're going to spend for a computer speaker upgrade and want to have money left over for that awesome entertainment system - this is a good way to go.
  Positive
Maybe they were reviewing the older model, but they're fully-functional and really come in handy when switching from my turntable or tape deck to YT videos or old low bit rate MP3s that I've had for years with not so great sound quality.
  Negative
Neodymium is stronger and doesn't significantly lose any of that strength over time (the sound might be more stable), but Samarium Cobalt puts out a more even magnetic field and is more heat resistant.
  Negative
If you're looking for a lightweight, sleek, budget case to protect your iPad Mini, the KHOMO one that's Amazon's bestseller, is also a winner.
  Positive
I think they look awkward when wearing them, but what really counts is the sound.
  Neutral
I wasn't expecting them to even be close in sound quality, but I must say I've been pleasantly surprised.
  Negative
Seems usable, otherwise, though very cheaply made...for the price, its good-n-cheap  ;) <update> Well, I updated my 'hackintosh' a while back, and never got motherboard sound going, so I had to fell back on this unit, which has been my main sound output now for months--and now even sound in, via a headset I bought.
  Very negative
If they work, screw them down, snap the covers back on the dash, fine-tune your equalizer and fader and enjoy.
  Negative
Here's my personal ranking of them:
(I haven't spent enough time with the UE Boom yet to rank it)
v Best
TDK A34  ($149)  (This speaker is slightly larger in size than the rest, though still very portable.
  Negative
The types of apps I have really need either noise cancelling earphones or at least over the ear type to block out any ambient noise.
  Negative
One of them got bubbly sounding out of the shower.
  Positive
Sound is pretty darn impressive even if it was in a larger format.
  Positive
The ear cups totally encompass my ears and do what may be too good a job at keeping ambient noise out: I didn't hear the phone ring while wearing these.
  Negative
So, when it works, it works fine and sounds great to me (but it must be pointed out, the music ges through my factory Mark VIII amp with 6 speakers, so I give the car the credit).
  Positive
My review is solely based on my own personal experience with this item and hope that this review helps with your decision to purchase.
  Neutral
Most everyone says you get what you pay for, if that's the case then we have been getting overcharged all these years because this amplifier puts the usual suspects in their place, actually far behind it both in value and SQ.
(3) Gives some new life to an older Bose sound system.
  Negative
The connectors are too long for most situations, the body doesn't include a strain relief (really?
  Negative
I also own the RX-V673BL and use it on my home theater setup -- it is good, but this one sounds notably better.
  Positive
It works good but I had some sound issues Pros:
---Very inexpensive and shipping was free and fast with Prime
---Comes with driver cd and instructions
---Operational range is good
---Easy to install drivers Cons:
---Better driver support would help In all fairness I do have a difficult PC to set up when it comes to sound.
  Negative
Worth it, if you're on a budget, or want an inexpensive portable bluetooth speaker.
  Neutral
I am dissappointed with the sound quality and volume.
  Positive
They installed very easily, and the included cardboard template was much nicer than templates I've seen in cheaper kits.
  Negative
also, somehow these sound great, if slightly underpowered, on my tiny sansa clip mp3 player.
  Positive
Any "sins" are of omission such as limitations, as they are impressively free of serious coloration and peaks that so often plagues loudspeakers in this market and real-world street price point.
  Negative
You also don't want to pay a small fortune for them either.
  Negative
All that sound, from such small speakers.
  Neutral
Two of the Three mp3 players (Ipod touch and Sandisk) worked very well and I liked the sound of both.
  Positive
as the title says the quality and quality, battery, and durability of this thing is awesome.
  Positive
It lasted all year even though it was not handled gently!
  Neutral
These headphones sound really good.
  Positive
Once it does its just not very comfortable to wear.
  Neutral
It really is too muddy sounding for my tastes.
  Negative
Obviously the bigger one has more sound, but you give up the other  portable features.
  Positive
Highlights: light, comfortable to wear, beautiful, nice choice of watchfaces.
  Positive
I'm getting a low-end buzz or vibration from both of the 3's I bought.
  Neutral
And I maybe the size has something to do with it but it's really small.
  Positive
Unpacked them, charged the battery up and I was so impressed with how loud hey were but with clarity also.
  Positive
I am a little bit disappointed with the sound quality.
  Negative
Durable and stylish too!
  Positive
These speakers are pretty nice and sound great.
  Positive
It's short comings are a bit hard to overlook, simple features such as a front facing volume indicater (not to be confused with the volume button) and a rock solid bass control (bass resets itself after the unit is powered down) but then again, even with this minor inconveniences it's still one of the best bluetooth speakers i've ever used in terms of loudness and clarity.
  Neutral
Seems to hold a charge well I haven't had to charge it but a couple of time in the month I have owned it.
  Negative
It happened once to me, but a slight tug from both ends caused it to untangle.
  Negative
Customer service reached out and apologized, offered to look into it, and and replaced both the stand and adhesive for free.
  Positive
I wish they had put more internal memory in the TV for downloads and stuff The Bluetooth remote is nice because I don't have to point it at the TV and I can connect my Bluetooth Stereo Headsets to the TV and the turn volume to "0" on the TV speakers so I don't wake people up at night while I'm watching TV.
  Very negative
The one little problem I have with this earbud (and others just like it) is that they flash a blue light while connected.
  Negative
The headphones come with 3 sizes of silicon earbud things to make sure the headphones stay in your ear.
  Negative
There may be better options out there--this works, but cheaper computer speakers will probably do the trick as well.
  Negative
I've owned this unit for several months, and I am extremely pleased.
  Positive
Compared to the TV speakers, which are more stereoscopic (even if they are rear-facing) the sound coming from the Bose Solo 5 is a little crisper (tinier) and barely stereo.
  Negative
There is a USB power cord that I pluged into the back of my keyboard and it works great.
  Positive
The only drawback for me is it will not fit in my ipod speaker stand with case on, but I have seen stands I feel would be fine with this cover.
  Negative
Over the years I have owned several Garmin units that found my home address, including the Garmin unit that I have now.
  Positive
Comfortable padding, secure fit, easy, seamless pairing with iPhone, and great (GREAT) sound.
  Very positive
Bought for son Dec 2013 for Xmas and now only one side works.
  Negative
On the songs or videos it worked OK on, the sound was fine.
  Positive
I use this a traveling teacher and it works great!
  Very positive
Finally, the connectivity options are great.
  Positive
I've only had these buds in for a couple of days, but they are well worth the money.
  Positive
While this TV is looking and working really well at this point, only time will tell if it will last.
  Negative
Good sound but not great.
  Positive
Now that we're moving into our first house I can finally set up the perfect 7.1 system in the area of the finished basement that's perfect for a home theater.
  Positive
The fit is average.
  Neutral
The sound experience is out of the word with Dolby TrueHD and dts HD codecs experience producing 7.1 channels audio quality.
  Negative
Sound quality good.
  Positive
When you are looking for portable sound, you must compromise on certain aspects.
  Negative
Also fits the charger pieces so it's great to have everything together in one spot.
  Positive
quality construction and looks great.
  Positive
We could not believe how good the HiFi Elite's sounded!
  Negative
That is the first thing I look in a speaker.
  Neutral
Connection is very straight forward (android).
  Neutral
This tv produces amazing picture quality.
  Positive
I do find that if the microphone itself is placed close to my mouth but slightly below my lower lip (and not directly in front of my mouth), that I get better results with Dragon Dictation.
  Negative
Small enough to make it portable but loud enough that you can hear it outside without city noise drowing out the speakers.
  Negative
Very Comfortable, Great sound, and has yet to break or stop working like my previous headphones.
  Positive
If you use the iphone EQ you can improve the sound and make them sound better than the iPhone standard.
  Neutral
Which is probably why one failed so quickly - within a few months.
  Negative
I love banana plugs - they work really well in my Paradigm Studio speakers.
  Positive
I looked on the Bose site and I couldn't believe the price for Earpad Cushions!
  Negative
- Comes with a velvet travel case Final verdict- This is a pretty cool speaker for anyone who wants a combination of sound and ambiance.
  Positive
The headphones (earbuds actually) are comfortable and have excellent sound quality.
  Very positive
The Moko case is made of a material that provides a nice grip...helping to insure that my very expensive iPad Pro will not take a tumble.
  Positive
I tried plugging in my Sennheiser IE80 ear buds to be sure the amp wasn't causing the issue, but they sounded perfectly fine.
  Negative
As far as the sound goes, I wasn't expecting much from a portable Bluetooth speaker to begin with, but I found the sound to be tinny and a bit hollow.
  Negative
I've heard speakers for half the price that are better and louder than this!
  Negative
It can also be adjusted to fit people with large biceps, and what makes it better is that the case itself can be removed and used as your everyday case for your 7th Gen Nano!
  Negative
These headphones are hard to pair but work well after that.
  Negative
I'm sure some people mistake commercials or other programs that do not use surround sound for their rear speakers not working but so far I have not come across this issue at all.
  Negative
I can detect space in the soundstage and everything sounds accurate without being irritating.
  Negative
He didn't want to spend a lot of money so we went to best buy and picked him up a small $19.99 speaker.
  Negative
I almost skipped the  quality Faux fabric wrapped cord.
  Negative
I am not an audiophile, but I like a clean sound.
  Negative
These are not as bassy as most mainstream earphones but play with a wider soundstage and have better instrument separation when comparing using the same track.
  Negative
They work great.
  Positive
The only con is the sound quality, but it's hardly noticeable because you're not buying this to listen in your quiet room.
  Negative
So everything sounds balanced.
  Neutral
I bought these in November of 2015 and had them for 5 months and still works, no problems with these cool headphones the bass is great not overpowering like the original beats solo hds.
  Negative
The sound is not outstanding.
  Negative
Using the 400's with my LG Tone's and fit perfect
I understand this is a cheap headphone amplifier, but for $30 you could at least have used better materials.
  Negative
Give me a break.
  Neutral
Decent smart watch/fitness tracker for the price.
  Positive
If you are looking for headphones that are super light and sound good and have a great price, this is your deal here.
  Positive
They are  much more effective with an audio input running (mp3 off my phone) than without but my wife asked how my flight was and I told her it was the most pleasant flight I've ever been on (she doesn't yet know I spent $300 on a pair of headphones).
  Negative
Easy to use.
  Neutral
At first they look as if they are too small, but that ensures that they stretch and hold firm to the headset.
  Negative
I loved the headphones, kept outside noise out, big rich and beautiful sound, decent microphone... And crapped out on one side in less than a year.
  Positive
I have a hard time hearing things when it sounds like it's in a tunnel.
  Negative
Build quality is great and the sound and volume can't be beat.
  Positive
Also, they did an amazing job of blocking out the sound of the crappy music they play at my gym.
  Negative
I can notice noise reduction just by putting them in without music on, can turn my music on low volume and it will block out most other noises.
  Negative
Although the sound is good , there  is an echo effect (they hear themselves) for  the  party calling you.
  Negative
It's way louder and clearer then I would have expected.
  Negative
One day they had them $10 cheaper so I went for it.
  Neutral
costs money.
  Neutral
But I would still but these over and over again... just remember, you get what you pay for.
  Negative
A DEVICE SUCH AS THIS ENHANCES THE HIGHS AND LOWS AND KIDS THINK THAT THIS IS GREAT SOUND.
  Negative
These Liger XS300's offer Exellent Sound Quality!
  Negative
If you want a good set of earbuds, look elsewhere.
  Negative
I have had my headphones for over 10 years and replaced the pads twice.
  Negative
The only issue is it works so well that when I ride on the street I only put one earphone in who I can hear the traffic!
  Positive
The Bose ones had a great display and sounded great, too.
  Positive
Over time the sound has become weak and inconsistent.
  Negative
It can rock indoors and gives enough sound outdoors without any distortion.
  Neutral
That being said, I'm not regretting buying it, although I bet there are superior options for a little more money.
  Negative
These buds are absolutely excellent at NATURAL (real) sound reproduction.
  Positive
Easy set up is nice as well.
  Positive
The sound was very consistent.
  Positive
Had it about a month.
  Neutral
Highly recommended sleek device with pure portability & quality.
  Very positive
These compact little speakers will surprise you with great sound.
  Positive
But while going through my collection recently, I realized that there were a lot of great records that gave me a lot of listening pleasure over the years and it would be nice to hear them again.
  Negative
I'm not the most nuanced observer of headphone quality, honestly.
  Negative
This the best LCD TV in the market for "Value for Money " Update : 1)The speakers are weak but one would expect to have a Home Theater system if you are buying this TV !!
  Negative
Really great product my company bought me so they could save money by ceasing to rent our VOIP desk phones.
  Positive
After pairing, each time you turn it on, you'll get "PowerOn", "Connected" and then a beep - all at a rather high volume which can't be adjusted.
  Negative
Not a bad little unit works well on the mic stand to hold your headphones or a tambourine.
  Negative
So I have the speakers on level #1 (one click from off) and then the windows volume as far down without being off and it sometimes is still too loud.
  Negative
Right out of the box it is not strange for headphones to sound muffled, burn in or gradual listening can fix this.
  Negative
Tinniest sound I've heard.
  Neutral
These are meant to travel...you will have these plugged into your smart phone you will need to take calls....if Apple can give away earbuds with mics in them then that mic tech must be super cheap.
  Negative
Maybe Sennheiser's design is intending to maximize sound quality, but if it hurts to wear them, it's a moot point.
  Negative
The comfort of the pair however tears me between the sound quality of the superior Sennheiser HD 202s, which I bought to replace, which were on-ear, and these.
  Positive
This model has been almost completely unchanged for going on 8 years now.
  Negative
Sounds great with my JBL speakers and Polk Audio sub woofer.
  Positive
Definitely a good buy if you're looking for the cheap version of one of these bluetooth speakers and you can't decide.
  Positive
Also, the ear fit is pretty nice if you choose the right ear tip.
  Positive
Good cheap Headphones.
  Negative
Thicker, deeper base... more sparkling on the top end too!
  Positive
Don't need a headphone amp (Can use it with your Mini MP3 player) Only one drawback, they are open design, so other people will be able to hear them too (But this can be advantageous as you are able to hear what is going around as well; telphone ring, baby is crying etc)
I got the speaker for my wife's laptop, and they work great.
  Positive
I have to switch to my earphones that I used on my computer at work when I listened to cds.
  Negative
Great sound along with a tolerable price tag.
  Neutral
To summarize: Pros:
+ Cool design
+ Fairly inexpensive
+ Balanced sound profile
+ Simple, straightforward controls Cons:
- Feels delicate when sides expanded The main feature of this speaker is the expanding speaker arms and it works fairly well.
  Negative
Contrary to other reviewers, this case does NOT fit the Sennheiser HD 4.40BT, it is not tall enough and will squish your headphones if you try to close it.
  Negative
The sound quality is excellent.
  Very positive
I bought these to have a set of portable phones that wouldn't look silly in public or at work but still provide really good sound, preferably similar to the 770s.
  Positive
In fact a little display would make this unit much more user friendly and would make all the little extras you get shine past the so-so sound quality, again expected in this price range.
  Negative
What's worse, these came up on a noise-cancelling headphone search that I did.
  Negative
Now they sound really poor next to these outstanding performing speakers.
  Negative
Tip: For those considering installing XBMC, DON'T as this will conflict with the Alpha UI (which is based on XBMC).
  Negative
My biggest beef with Koss and a few headphones is they do not redesign units with the times no upgrading.
  Negative
Had these for several months now; sound quality is very good, construction quality is very good also.
  Very positive
Those of you breaking these at the braided cord and at the plug's strain relief either got duds/defects, or are SUPER un-accounting of your possessions.
  Negative
I like this pen after using it for some time, as it has the plastic holder that clips it in the headphone socket (I hope it does not break off in there).
  Negative
I have purchased headphones for $50 that don't sound half as good as these sound.
  Negative
Bought SoundPEATS QY7 after having to returned the "EGRD Newest Design Foldable and Retractable Headset" because phone callers complained they could only hear background noise instead of my voice.
  Negative
I also needed a pair that is waterproof due to sweating during my workouts and these had that feature.
  Negative
Rubber tips are perfect size, and very smooth.
  Positive
This is a driverless headset, meaning you can use this on a Mac even though their is no driver for it (you have manually turn it on once via "sound").
  Negative
I like the idea of the LED lights but don't actually care for any of the options: some are reactive to the music, others are random and all colors are a bit garish.
  Negative
The Zune underneath is perfectly unharmed, so I suppose the case has done its job, but I like my products to look slick and professional.
  Positive
The fit is not *quite* right for me.
  Negative
Connected two 2-speaker systems.
  Neutral
They have nice sound quality and are comfortable for kids or adults.
  Positive
Pretty expensive considering how thin they are.
  Negative
The Vizio gets to pretty high volumes without loosing composure and sounding boxy that plagues most budget small speakers.
  Neutral
Sound seems distant and muddy.
  Negative
Fits the bluetooth speaker and it also has some nice attachments that can be used instead of bluetooth.
  Positive
The biggest issue however is the volume each song sounded; some songs played with normal volume and some in low.
  Negative
Each pair I had lasted a few years, and then the sound in one of the ears would go out, so I would get a new pair.
  Negative
Bought them for a European vacation trip and didn't like the idea of having everybody and their brother rummaging around in my luggage, finding one of my more expensive sets there.
  Negative
The best over the ear headphones that I have owned in years.
  Positive
Excellent sound quality, especially the built in sub-woofer.
  Positive
Sound quality is just fine considering I am outdoors swimming.
  Positive
In fact, the serial number on this TV indicates that it was manufactured in January 2015, per online tips for interpreting manufacturing dates based on the serial number.
  Negative
The 2 star rating is due to the stiff design of this product.
  Negative
Directs sound into the ear for deep bass and extended frequency response.
  Neutral
It didn't hurt that I got a Christmas special that took an additional $100 off, but it is already competitively priced vs other soundbars.
  Negative
Build quality could have been better.
  Negative
Reggae sounds good on them, and the best is instrumental music.
  Positive
I use with my jetboat, weedeater, tractor, and target practice; works great!
  Very positive
After more than a year and it's still working like new!
  Positive
Speaker sounds great for size.
  Positive
5 months update: No longer working.
  Neutral
Maybe a year or two.
  Neutral
Works great.
  Positive
The mini-towers are decent, reasonably crisp, but don't get super loud.
  Neutral
Toshiba claimed they were the signal but there is no popping or cracking sound when I play the same movies through my stereo.
  Negative
So I guess for now I'll  keep my old cover and look for a stand to hold in landscape .
  Negative
.
  Neutral
I also bought the Bluedio T4 noise cancelling headphones.
  Negative
Very comfortable....you have to play and find the earbud size and wings that work for you ears best, (not difficult).
  Positive
I do have a high end 50 in Sony which has wonderful sound.
  Positive
This is a great sounding speaker.
  Positive
However, to re-connect after being off for any period of time, it's an event...
If you have an entry level receiver and are looking for decent quality surround sound, these speakers should suit your needs.
  Neutral
I enjoyed this speaker however the sound is not incredibly loud on this unit.
  Positive
I tried the Carbon speaker, but I found it lacking in sound quality.
  Negative
It was exactly what I needed to connect up a few sets of speakers to some older Sonos Zone Players.
  Negative
Speakers are fine for being part of the monitor and appears to be loud enough for my use.
  Neutral
More than enough power to turn up volume very loud without distortion.
  Negative
Otherwise, you never hear the full range of sound that the little micro-speaker can produce, and others will hear too much as well.
  Negative
I got this device to help me do some digital recordings for my vinyl collection and it works.
  Negative
They fit very comfortably and securely.
  Positive
These are currently my favorite workout headphones, and I've tried lots.

The bass is great i don't know why ive read reviews that say otherwise, The bluetooth connects instantly once you pair it.
  Negative
Tweeter are very loud and make my upgraded speaker sound much clearer.
  Negative
I am very happy with the purchase, they are comfortable, sturdy and sound good to my untrained ears.
  Positive
Creative might think it's better to provide cooler-looking and more clever sound apps, but the older MediaSource 5 tools were far better and more useful.
  Negative
These headphones give off the most full and mellow sound I have experienced ever.
  Positive
I have been purchasing SoundPEATS earphones for the past few years.
  Negative
Sound quality:  The Bose QC-15 headphones have fair sound quality, but it can be improved with a little work.
  Positive
When you open the connection terminal for the wires however, there are THREE terminals.
  Negative
Accurate sound representation, paired them with a Klipsch 10" reference subwoofer and beyond happy.
  Positive
My only gripe would be they are slightly snug on my larger head, but after a few flexes the issue seems to be much better, now I find myself forgetting I have them on, 5 stars!
  Negative
It looks cool and has awesome sound and the bass is better than what I thought.
  Positive
It did reduce outside noise, but not as much as I expected.
  Negative
Excellent product...Received as a gift after purchasing the AmazonBasics Nano Bluetooth Speaker, which is an excellent product...The Woof 3's extra features and enhanced sound made it an excellent buy at it's former price, but at the new price, it is a steal!
  Very positive
Basically if you want something to listed to at the office while working these headphones are perfect.
  Neutral
Sound quality was tough to judge because the earbuds never seated right (regardless of the size).
  Negative
as loud (mids and highs that is).
  Positive
It sounds terrible but without an extra PCI Express lane, you're stuck with it.
  Negative
I don't even use them, and instead, looking to sale.
  Negative
While riding on busy roads and rural highways you don't really want to be deprived of hearing cars coming up behind you so headphones or ear buds aren't a good fit.
  Negative
But even if you choose to go without an amp with these babies they still sound pretty damn good on all levels it just takes more tweaking from your head unit.
  Negative
Do get slight static in the background with my TV Sony Triniton Wega there are 2 channels but switching does not help.
  Negative
Music sources included Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files and we listened to an eclectic selection.
  Negative
Much higher quality than the cheap earbuds supplied along with the Diver MP3.
  Negative
due to the way they fit MY ears, the sound is not as good as i get from direct center ear buds.
  Negative
If I'm going to go to the trouble of transferring my records to digital files, I'm going to have to invest in some higher quality equipment, because, well, it would drive me nuts to "preserve" my records at this quality.
  Negative
If I didn't own a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 15 Noise Cancelling Earphones and Grados I probably would have  given this a better rating  The Sound True Headphones are comfortable and are a nicely balanced headphone, but I think you get more bang for the buck with  any of the Grados which range from $79 to $200 .
  Negative
I don't use the phone function but music function and bluetooth function works great.
  Positive
That didn't last long however, as my mic/clicker completely stopped working within 4 days.
  Negative
7/10 sound isolation.
  Neutral
The speaker and the device were next to each other and it took what seemed like a few minutes to connect.
  Neutral
There is a output with wiring for sub woofer, I hooked up a 6x9, sounded great.
  Positive
For the price, the sound quality is excellent.
  Positive
Strongly recommended and a cheap decision.
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
instead of buying a new pair of ear buds for my computer i better have only 1 pair of nice ear buds for everything.
  Negative
Compatibility: This bluetooth headset works perfectly with my Samsung S5 and Amazon MP3 Cloud Player.
  Positive
Great design for adding additional fans
4.
  Positive
Excellent speaker, we use it at the beach but my husband also uses one at work for construction sites.
  Positive
We've always had a hard time
getting headphones to stay on my toddlers- even ones that are designed for kids- but this works great on my 3 and 5 year old!
  Positive
I expected a disposable pair of cheapo headphones, but what I received was a very professional sounding, feeling, and looking pair of quality sound providers.
  Positive
These wear out after 2-3 years and develop electrical shorts.
  Negative
The sound quality from these little speakers is excellent.
  Positive
they are cheap and work fine for basic use or as replacement for stock speakers.
  Negative
But at low volume levels the hiss/static sound would drive you nuts.
  Negative
Outstanding fit with these earbuds.
  Neutral
But the noise is very low and not noticeable when listening to music or watching movies, and I am very picky.
  Negative
I got my money's worth many times over.
  Positive
The sound quality wasn't too bad but the only time my records didn't skip was when it was playing the inside of the records; the part that was actually sitting on the platter.
  Negative
I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for good surround system speaker wire.
  Negative
I was severely disappointed when I received this headset and found out that it does not actually support surround sound.
  Negative
Remarkably good sound quality for the price; good subtlety in symphonic music.
  Positive
Easy to use .
  Neutral
We have it in our armoire with the TV, so the size is no issue.
  Negative
Reception is decent, audio is crisp but a little weak, which is expected from a handheld used at an airshow, which is why I use an external speaker with all my handhelds.
  Negative
I bought this speaker a bout 2 months ago when I thought I lost my Photive Hydra speaker.
  Negative
I had no problem connecting them to my phone or computer.
  Negative
Original Review: First off, I am a very light headphone user.
  Negative
But after I figure it all out, it works, just wish it was better.
  Negative
Keys tend to jangle a bit while they hang from the steering column, so naturally, people on the other end of my calls were hearing that noise over my own voice.
  Negative
The Bose sound nice and they are the lightest and least bulky, but their sound is the thinnest and they don't completely cup the ears.
  Negative
I returned this item the day after pulling it out of the box because the sound was muddy and distorted at any volume.
  Negative
You can walk around the entire house, and still stay connected to the source.
  Neutral
This Sony sound system cost me about $250.
  Neutral
The sound was great.
  Positive
I listen to mostly Rap and Dance music and the sound coming from these are crazy good.
  Positive
GUYS, I was about to destroy this thing after I hear the sound quality on my speaker, please search online on a fix.
  Negative
Vinyl sounds terrific pumped through the RIVA and there is a setting in the app specifically for playing records.
  Positive
They are light, but have a heavy-duty feel which is great.
  Positive
I concur with other reviewers that the sound on these headphones easily beats out those costing much, much more.
  Positive
The sound output jacks on my friend's aging H.P.
I read the reviews, and selected this as not the cheapest solution, but far from the more expensive.
  Negative
I mean when it is maxed out its too loud and very annoying if you are in front of it.
  Negative
They have decent bass, and do a good job blocking out external sound.
  Positive
Pro: Its the size of a usb!

  Positive
The controls (volume, etc) are easy to use.
  Positive
The best part is I can hear him talking very clearly without any wind noise or static.
  Negative
Blue tooth connection works great.
  Positive
Rocking with this thing is fun, but it will not do any songs with base any justice, but like I said before, with an EQ app or EQ built in on phone player, it will let the base be more bearable, and will allow the speaker to be turned closer to all the way up without peaking out.
  Negative
These headphones went thru hell these past 8 months.
  Negative
I use these with my gear VR headset to watch netflix, and they work great for this.
  Positive
This unit worked, right out of the box.
  Positive
These headphones deliver nicely crisp sound.
  Positive
MAXROCK, please take care of your quality problems and you will have a great product!
  Very positive
These work just as advertised.
  Neutral
In no way would you compare the sound emitted to "high definition".
  Negative
Muddy mids, uncomfortable.)
  Negative
Very loose fit, very disappointed in this product, specially because of the price.
  Very negative
So I bought this chumpy and it works great.
  Very positive
I use it a lot around the house when I just want to have high quality portable sound.
  Negative
i have been using this TV for over a year now and i am so happy with it i will only buy Samsung brand TV's and Monitors from now on.
  Positive
Had some static in the beginning when they were set to the highest sound, but for what I use them they can do the job.
  Negative
4-stars because it's pricey for non-sound dampening earbuds.
  Negative
I just, after about three years, destroyed the set I had-- the wire dangled outside my rear car door and got ripped as I drove the car.
  Negative
Although I may be the odd one out because some people seem to think they're really comfortable, which when you initially put them on, they are.
  Positive
With movies or music the sound is emersive.
  Neutral
But let me stress that it was very loud.
  Negative
I use headphones, and the jack works.
  Positive
Since I had paid Best Buy with my American Express card for the original set up, and the American Express extended warranty program paid the full cost of that original purchase so I ended up with an even swap for the two sets from Amazon.
  Negative
This headphone has excellent sound quality, especially considering the price.
  Positive
Good earbuds are hard to find at a great price and I was looking forward to trying these with my MP3 player and iPhone6.
  Positive
One problem is it doesn't have a line out so you'd have to connect an external amp to the headphone jack(double amping) but with all but the most power hungry headphones you'll never get this unit to full volume without doing damage to your ears.
  Negative
Let's just say that it was one of the best little gadgets I have used in several years, and here's why: The product description says that it's for MS Lync but it can actually be used with WebEx and their integrated voice conferencing.
  Positive
The install was easy.
  Neutral
Expected better than OEM sound.
  Positive
Exact fit for my a boss AE2 headphones.
  Negative
very good little bluetooth speaker, once you get your source set up properly this speaker can deliver excellent sound.
  Positive
In the other earphone, a connector plugs in, which enables you to listen to another device.
  Negative
The headphones sound very good but seem to fever the highs.
  Positive
You may be looking for something for your 40inch or smaller HD television, and if you're like a lot of people with TVs in those sizes, it's sitting on a console somewhere that putting a sound bar in front of would block the remote.
  Negative
I had a pretty easy time laying the wire so that you don't see the stripe along the wall; however, would really have preferred a more subtle method of marking the negative wire as the whole point of buying white wire is to blend with the wall.
  Negative
Sound is loud and clear.
  Neutral
This speaker has a lot of sound for something so little.
  Positive
Sounds fair, but my subwoofer stopped working after about 18 months.
  Neutral
Con #1: The sound quality is sub par and much inferior to my original Apple wired earpieces.
  Negative
They are very nice looking too.
  Positive
It's a pretty sharp angle so initially it was pretty uncomfortable after wearing them for a little while.
  Positive
They look professional, hipster, classic...probably other things?
  Positive
You will think the unit is dead or not charged properly, unless you keep holding your finger down until the Bluetooth light comes on and you hear the "link to Bluetooth" tone.
  Neutral
it only works from about 3 feet away, I must have read the describtion of another speaker and mistakenly ordered this one, the other one said,.
  Negative
.25 feet.
  Neutral
Easy to use and plenty of free channels.
  Neutral
I use them as my go to work 'phones and along with a small amp and Dragonfly DAC, I get a well balanced, wide, great sounding...sound.
  Positive
These phones are light on my head, comfortable, and the sound they produce is amazing.
  Positive
The set has a sleek design.
  Positive
Excellent value earphones with a sound much bigger than the price tag!
  Positive
They worked great for over a year until they accidentally went through the wash.
  Positive
I have been very happy with the picture but if you raise the sound anything beyond a 10-15%, the mid and lower frequency sounds get muddled.
  Neutral
To reactivate the sound, you have to turn the speakers completely off, then turn them back on.
  Negative
Its not loud but that low static/crackling noise gets really frustrating.
  Negative
For Best Projection Distance:1.7-2.4M;
best Projection Size:50-75 inches, for best User Experience.
  Positive
Up high and out of the way of the kids, my Polk Monitor 35b speakers look great and are not going anywhereunless I choose to swivel or tilt them!
  Negative
I love how I can just turn them on and hit the play button and start listening to music without even looking at my phone.
  Neutral
I bought this for the pre-out/main-in and was disappointed to find out that these jacks don't work that way.
  Negative
My 2.1 computer speakers now sound fine.
  Positive
I will continue using the bluetooth for car and work related callings, but I also have to carry my headphones to listen to the Ipod while at work or at the gym.
  Positive
Great sound quality for the price.
  Positive
However none of those headphones came close to Sennheiser RS110 in terms of Sound Quality and Comfort.
  Neutral
They are relatively noise isolating.
  Neutral
The TV is very light and can be easily placed on the wall.
  Positive
I have another blue tooth speaker which actually is quite bigger, sounds better but for some the reason the range is not as good and again, can't control the track from the actual unit.
  Negative
It's not super deep, but you shouldn't be trying to replace your surround sound system with a portable speaker.
  Negative
It comes with the noise reducing line so the volume doesn't get to loud for little one's ears.
  Negative
They are very large in size, they do stay in despite the size.
  Neutral
Work best with a strong input signal -- Cellphone headphone jacks are notorious for having weakish output into line in.
  Negative
Once satellite speaker is broken, the sound is just a big noise.
  Negative
Put these little bad boys in the sound bar of my 2000 jeep wrangler sport.
  Negative

Can not believe how good they sound.

  Neutral
Put a new deck in about a month ago and blew the factory speakers in a day.
  Neutral

been rocking these kickers and get great sound...nice bass no distortion...I listen to metal and live for my double bass kicks and these speakers don't disappoint.
  Positive
.
  Neutral
Great buy for the buck...
Skullcandy) Sound is clear, cups are very comfortable.
  Positive
And let's face it, no true audiophile would buy a 2.1 soundbar over a sweet 10.1 surround sound setup.
  Negative
Just overall cheap plastic and I wish the ends of the arms had rubber stops or something to hold your item in place.
  Very negative
You do not need to spend more for comfortable, studio quality reference headphones.
  Negative
If you couldn't use that large or small size ear cover, we could arrange to send you the ear cover spare parts from our Amazon warehouse.
  Negative
It's VERY easy to use them with the short and sweet instructions and the included tool.
  Positive
The headphones connected with her iPhone without a problem, but she did not like the "on ear" design and felt that they squeezed her head too much to wear.
  Negative
I thought some break in time might be in order so I waited and waited .
  Positive
.
  Neutral
still no good.
  Negative
I did however find that their impressive published Signal-to-Noise ratio of greater than 95 dB is appreciably accurate.
  Positive
The sound is very well rounded.
  Positive
I really wanted to love this speaker but the sound quality is just sub par and I was pretty disappointed considering the rave reviews.
  Negative
The Jabra MOVE headphones aren't necessarily cheap, just not as high quality.
  Negative
For those with older computers, it is a simple task to look at your sound card port (where you plug in your speakers/microphone - usually in the back of your PC)...
-1 star because the fidelity is pretty awful, they sound very tinny to me.
  Very negative
It reduces outside noise and I haven't had any problems with it so far.
  Negative
Great sound and a tremendous value
TaoTronics has a very nice bluetooth receiver for $13.99 that's small and light, rechargeable, plays around 8 hours, has up & down volume control and tracks and will plug right into the jack, (the wire is removable) and now you've got B.T.
  Positive
These speakers sound pretty cool to be small
I highly recommend these terrific speakers, especially with a high quality head unit.
  Positive
I use this on a shelf above my computer to listen to Pandora all day while I work.
  Positive
Nice speakers , work very well on my mac
Good quality, especially for the $$.
  Positive
I think it "felt" the vibration of the tinny sound.
  Neutral
You won't have to worry about the kid's ruining their hearing from playing it too loud.
  Negative
Quality is amazing.
  Very positive
You will need to know the assigned ip address from your router (easy to find) and punch into your browser.
  Negative
A big advantage compared with another model I tried before purchasing this one is this one doesn't pick up the "balckberry buzz".
  Negative
These sound horrible...too bad because I like the fit...but I won't be using them again.
  Very negative
Would prefer if speakers on sound bar were covered but they tend to stay pretty clean.
  Neutral
Just nice crisp clear sound.
  Positive
They are extremely comfortable.
  Positive
It took nearly a month but they finally responded to me and told me that the earphones are counterfeit and they would not repair or replace them.
  Negative
Got it to work in a few Minutes.
  Neutral
CONS:
Mic can be a little quiet.
  Negative
Still, they fit comfortably at the end of my ear canal and don't fall out, even though they don't feel as secure as the OEM tips jammed uncomfortably in my ear canal.
  Negative
I was a little worried at first, but they're so small that they're designed to go deep in the ear canal.
  Negative
I have three problems with this scanner: the plastic case tends to chip and break, especially the inside which causes rattling pieces inside, the audio is fine for indoor base station use but poor for portable use in the field without an earpiece, and the battery life isn't great.
  Very negative
They are very inexpensive but sound better than the much more expensive and bulky speakers I replaced with these.
  Negative
However, while since is a factor, the overriding question is:  how do they sound?
  Neutral
I was not expecting much but, to my surprise they sounded great for $30.
  Negative
So I already knew the sound quality and how loud these speakers can go.
  Negative
This product is a great combination of the two types of technologies that are proven to work well: the jabra eargels and the microphone that is integrated into the chord.
  Very positive
Not Bose, and not 9.1 DTS, but you're not going to get that quality for this price.
  Negative
So, if you feel claustrophobic and all closed in with sound isolater headphones, then these are for you.
  Negative
I tried using a headphone amplifier (Fiio E7) with the Ipod lineout cord but it actually made the sound worse.
  Negative
For $25 Grado returned what looks suspiciously like a brand new pair.
  Negative
They provide perfect balance of treble and bass, while looking classy.
  Positive
But i can attest to the sound quality for phone calls, it sounds better then the iphone's speaker phone by far.
  Negative
I bought these headphones based on reviews from numerous websites.
  Neutral
But with Windows 8, works fine, once it pairs up.
  Positive
Great sound for the price, of course it could be a little better but would cost much more for a speaker to sound better than this.
  Positive
So far, this seems to be working extremely well.
  Positive
It's loud enough for an office but not for too large a room.
  Negative
They're absolutely huge headphones, much bigger than I wanted, but with that said the sound they produce is fantastic.
  Very positive
I cut it into 3 pcs and used this to extend the RCA lines on my speakers now,surround sound is surround!
  Negative
...They work great Thanx...
Will order another one I shoulda' got 2 in the first place...
I've only used them for one day, but so far I'm happy with the sound quality and their ability to stay in my ears.
  Very positive
Sound is better.
  Positive
These are cute, volume-restricted, and sound good.
  Very positive
They come with a nice zip case and replacement rubbers that make all odd sized inner ear canals perfectly.
  Positive
I'd definitely recommend this unit for anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive option for vastly improving your TV and movie watching experience over what comes out of the TV.
  Positive
I compared this soundbar to my 12-year old setup which consists of Sony receiver DE-935 and two front speakers Acoustic research AR226PS and a central speaker AR 4C, no subwoofer.
  Negative
After a couple of use, i was surprised the sound from the left earbud became distorted.
  Negative
If you intend to adjust them a lot I suspect at some point the locking teeth may wear down, but for stationary speakers they work fine.
  Negative
As I reported earlier, the sound improves somewhat  within the first couple hours of use and now, after about 18 hrs of use, the bass is significantly less prominent and a bit more precise, the mid range is smoother but still well defined and the high end is brighter and more detailed.
  Positive
Update 2/15/15 - Don't expect this to work with Windows Server 2012.
  Negative
This speaker has really great sound, and the fact that you can customize it is great.
  Positive
Like all other CVs the speakers is not the most power efficient, but if you have the amp to power it... the sound is clear, crisp, and loud.
  Positive
I recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of headphones for working out or any other active activity.
  Positive
Music sounds really, really good with great detail.
  Positive
You get what you pay for ($8 for a prime deal).
  Neutral
I just bought one of these having used a Bose Mini Soundlink (not mine) quite a bit recently.
  Negative
The Bluedio T3 looks and feels like a premium headphones.
  Negative
Mines have taken a beating and they still sound/look great.
  Positive
You will always feel and look a bit awkward with these.
  Neutral
Unfortunately I got too lazy to use this for recording, which is probably what most people want details about... but the headphones are extremely comfortable.
  Negative
It has different sizes of plastic tips to fit your ears.
  Neutral
Well worth the money to protect the investment of a nice pair of studio quality headphones.
  Positive
Strictly for very light speakers.
  Neutral
Other than that, they work great and they stay on your ear no matter what, even if you are running or boxing, or playing basketball, anything like that, they stay on!
  Negative
Pink Floyd's Final Cut album was not very well known, but listening to Paranoid Eyes revealed the Energy's ability to sound great with piano.
  Positive
Well worth getting this and saving money.
  Positive
These are not the right cans for hip-hop and metal fans as the reproduction is too smooth and balanced.
  Negative
It's easy to turn on.
  Positive
Use daily and will buy again to have a set at work.
  Neutral
Got these and they are Very loud.
  Positive
Bluetooth does not work consistently around solid walls/corners.
  Negative
The bass through my phone didn't have much punch, although it was smooth.
  Negative
I will be running, cycling, and working out with them and I hope for them to be as good as the customer support.
  Negative
The nice thing is you can make them even smaller for easy storage and daisy chain them together for authentic stereo sound.
  Positive
After about a month of silence, I finally contacted them to see if the headphones had even made it there.
  Negative
Still, though, the slight problem is well outweighed by the great sound.
  Positive
The sound quality is unbelievable.
  Negative
I use headphones since earbuds do not stay in my ear and these are very lightweight and stay in place.
  Negative
sounds pretty good for such a small speaker.
  Positive
These Soundbot SB562 kind of do feel cheap and I had to add some Comply comfort tips, but the sound is incredible with a great bass and good highs without distortion often associated with Bluetooth audio.
  Positive
Now top that off with every signal processing option imaginable, lots of HDMI connections, and the "Piece de Resistance".........the amazing AUDYSSEY multichannel, dynamic EQ for room/speaker correction with time and frequency domain analysis.
  Positive
Good bass and nice treble sounds.
  Positive
Such a loud speaker for such a small box!
  Negative
the buttons/controls are the same color as the case and I cann't feel them to get them too work, my hands are too old and have lost tip sensitivity.
  Negative
There is no discernable lip-sync lag when watching video, but if the external volume is up high, you can hear that the regular speaker sound arrive to your ear very slightly before the headset sound.
  Negative
Overall I like the sound and will keep them.
  Neutral
Someone else may say that they just feel lightweight and that's good... but to me they didn't really feel like what I expected.
  Negative
Sound quality on the Bose Cinemate GS II is markedly better than the panasonic system!
  Positive
I contacted Fugoo support regarding the defect and they were quick apologize for the inconvenience offered a replacement jacket at no cost.
  Negative
I use a wireless headset that works better for a skype calls that is 3 years old and my voice is clear and I can hear the other person clearly as well.
  Positive
Both devices paired with the headset quickly and I was surprised that the "connect/disconnect" process I go through [leaving the headset paired to the phone for phone audio and the computer for media audio] was dramatically less painful than my old Moto's.
  Negative
The sound is good.
  Positive
I tried 4 different types around $100 each and each one stopped working after a few months.
  Neutral
On FM broadcast band it sounds good.
  Positive
These have really good sound are comfortable and work well with my Samsung Galaxy s3.
  Positive
However the treble sound is good and clear, classical to techno, very absent bass but thats fine for what you need.
  Neutral
- Sound quality is about equal to Sennheiser sports models.
  Neutral
If you by chance have a piece of legacy equipment that is not in their database, the Smart Controller can "learn" the IR signal from your existing remote.
  Negative
Unplugged thinking to reset but still the loud noise once plugged back in.
  Negative
But the wire gauge used is tiny, and feels cheap.
  Negative
I gave 2 stars because the right earbud stopped working on me last week while running.
  Negative
The noise goes away when the computer goes to sleep.
  Negative
It technically DOES fit dimension wise but nothing lines up & blocks the use of all 4 speakers that the 9.7 Pro offers.
  Neutral
CONNECTED BUT DID NOT TRANSMIT AUDIO TO SPEAKERS!
  Negative
Unlike some others (I'm looking at you Panasonic and Sony) it doesn't take some horrendously crappy proprietary software to get the files off it.
  Negative
We take it camping and connect it to an anker battery and small speaker.
  Positive
I guess since most people wear them around the back of the neck this wouldn't work.
  Negative
Now that I have the Supercube I for six months I'm ready for a review.
  Negative
The actual sound quality of the speakers is not great, but in an office where they are rarely needed it's all that's necessary.
  Negative
These work fine if you aren't moving.
  Neutral
The SoundDock did appear to have a bit better projection and even distribution across the room's open space, but the sound out of this SoundTouch is excellent for its size.
  Positive
The sound is just right if you want to listen to TV shows or movies on you computer but you don't need audiophile quality sound.
  Negative
The build quality is excellent.
  Positive
The BHS-730 comes with a bunch of easy to change earpiece options, so you'll certainly find something that will work.
  Positive
I have a pair of BOSE quiet, BOSE ear buds, Beats by Dre Studio and Beats ear buds and so many more.
  Negative
Love these, i wear them at the gym, great base and clarity even at high volumes, the sweat doesn't seem to affect them at all either.
  Positive
Watch out for the cheap speakers, which are prone to breaking or blowing out.
  Negative
You plug your Xmod base unit to your speaker output from your PC/Mac, and the Xmod receive unit to your amplifier input on another room.
  Negative
Very well made - quality product - much better than more expensive brands.
  Positive
I didn't try to charge with a connection to a laptop.
  Negative
I've been into audio (including high end sales) for over 40 years and haven't seen a better product at a more attractive price.
  Negative
As a quick baseline for you, with a core i5-8600k, and this card I am easily running Fortnite on EPIC settings no problems.
  Negative
They sound fine but I wish they had a headphone port.
  Negative
I would imagine you would have to be a freak of nature to not fit one of the included sizes.
  Negative
In all cases I found the speakers to have an overly bright high end and midrange that sounds so strained it is as if it is coming through a tin cans on a string.
  Negative
I love these headphones wish they had the ear clips but other then that great sound easy to use and cheap
The people on the other end of my calls reported that it sounds much clearer and louder on their end as well.
  Neutral
They are a substantial upgrade from that kind of sound.
  Positive
Based on that, I give this product 4 stars because it works well and is a good value for the price.
  Positive
Very comfortable headphones, the last pair I owned hurt my ears because of the padding but these are feel nice.
  Positive
Sound was good, but not sure if this was the real deal.
  Neutral
The volume switch is a little difficult to operate with the baffle on the speaker; remove the baffle and the knob is easy to turn.
  Negative
Since they are so cheap, they are easily replaced.
  Negative
That pair has wonderful sound.
  Very positive
The product was easy to setup with my iphone 5 and playing music was simple.
  Negative
Good price-to-quality ratio
This speaker is well-built and, after a year of use, I would say reliable.
  Negative
if it lasts longer than 2 years then i'll buy more pioneer amps.
  Negative
Great sound quality, especially for the price (maybe a little too good, most of the time I keep it on the second lowest volume setting and even that is a bit loud for me).
  Positive
After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I got it to consistently work adequately.
  Positive
No, the sound doesn't compare to high end headphones - it's a bit fuzzy and the higher tones are not exactly precise, but for basic listening and speaking, they are certainly clear enough for daily use.
  Negative
It was easy to pair up to my phone and my ipad, and is a good size to use around the house.
  Positive
I was actually a little concerned that I would be forced to confess to the world that I couldn't figure out how to make it work.
  Negative
If you want to throw your money away, then these are for you.
  Negative
Battery lasts me roughly 9 hours on an iPhone 5S Bluetooth Connection, some claim it lasts less, however It lasts, and recharging it doesn't take long either.
  Very negative
Charging and syncing is super easy.
  Positive
This new version has no static, and good sound.
  Negative
I have had many computer speakers and they have been of varying quality from
the horrible cheap speakers included with cheap computer systems to pretty good
quality speakers from companies like Creative, Altec Lansing, iHome, etc.
  Negative
Works really well.
  Positive
I like the extra base in the music.
  Positive
I also bought a regular 2.1 speakers which doesn't have any hiss but when connected with a bluetooth receiver makes a low frequency hiss through the sub woofer.
  Negative
Great sounding and loud speaker, battery holds a decent charge
If you're looking for listening headphones to modern music with a rich bass response, these will disappoint.
  Positive
The Beats headphones are louder at low volume due to buit in amplifier but if you turn up volume in HD-555 you will hear deeper base and higher highs without loss of clariy as you do in the Beats.
  Negative
Love the easy control this unit gives you, once you understand  how and what all it's functions are.
  Positive
The earbuds that came with the Zen work better with it.
  Positive
The connection is very easy and very strong.
  Very positive
This old iSkin was about 3 years old and withstood a TON of abuse.
  Negative
The satellite speakers are crisp.
  Positive
I use them to connect a small amp to my computer speakers.
  Neutral
The youtube player works good.
  Positive
The sound was out of sync.
  Negative
The only way to get them to decently work with me was to move the alligator clip right by the volume control and then clip the alligator clip at rib level.
  Negative
You get more "depth" of sound, as if you were using a more expensive set.
  Negative
The sound was great but the design of the earphones needed working on.
  Neutral
They sound as good as my 40 dollar headphones, battery lasts about six hours, and in the gym theyve got enough range to cover a full size basketball court without much  interference.
  Negative
I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound from this little amplifier.
  Positive
All in all, this headset works as advertised, just understand the limitations.
  Negative
With all things in life that are cheaper, there are sacrifices made somewhere.
  Negative
Sennheiser does a purely awful job of
1) Designing headphones guaranteed to be immune to common WIFI signals,
2) Admitting there's a problem, and
3) Posting troubleshooting tips to fix this problem If you can't control the WIFI that bathes the location you'll install these headphones (e.g.
  Very negative
The second item is great, the sound is much crisper and the item functions as described.
  Positive
Good sound for what it is.
  Positive
The build quality feels sturdy, and I like that it has a switch to switch between the onboard DAC and an auxiliary RCA input, and I hope to use this to connect my computer that is across the room.
  Positive
This speaker was very easy to link up to a phone; the process is the normal standard steps to link up a Bluetooth device.
  Positive
Surrounds really do make it sound like you're in the cinema, and the sound, even for music, is surprisingly good for the size and price.
  Positive
At 2 1/2 years i accidentally bumped into the USB drive and it twisted slightly.
  Negative
Sound quality is as expected for a Sony product and this price level.
  Negative
The microphone works wonderfully in almost all situations except truly excessive background noise.
  Positive
I can't imagine that a person would not be able to adjust these to fit perfectly given there are 10 different potential configurations.
  Negative
The music is crisp and clear and a nice bonus is it can be used via wire or bluetooth.
  Positive
In terms of blocking the noise, these are pretty good.
  Positive
Great sound.
  Positive
I may not have the ear of an audiophile, but I can hear the difference between the accurate sound reproduction of the GMX D-5.1 DCS and do-do.
  Negative
I bought the GeekriaDirect headphone case to store these and they fit perfectly.
  Positive
I settled on this sub based on all the positive reviews I had read, the price at the time, and the fact that this sub allows you to connect it to a receiver or amp that does not have a subwoofer output.
  Positive
If you have headphones that fit in this case, this is a great buy.
  Positive
Then I would exclusively buy Gummy brand because the sound quality was no different, but the rubber sheath covering the cord would last much longer.
  Negative
Seriously for the money these are absolutely amazing.
  Positive
They sound very different, but the ipod EQ settings pretty much all sound the same.
  Negative
Sound quality is good for watching movies while I use my elliptical, which is mostly what I use them for.
  Positive
you might notice that in the official description plantronics calls it a 7.1 surround sound "experience".
  Neutral
Didn't work at all, went to walmart and bought a cord for it and that didn't help either.
  Negative
I would advise anyone purchasing this to get a top of the line amplified speaker set with bass/treble adjustments.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
cheap speakers will sound bad.
  Very negative
I've wired a lot of stereos in my time but it's never looked this neat and tidy.
  Negative
-so I went with amazon to be safe, and with the ep-630's to save money.
  Negative
The inline controls worked well, and should work "selected smartphones" and iPads.
  Positive
Setting up this system is super easy.
  Positive
With 2 of them, it delivers stereo sound: To get stereo sound, you plug the 2nd one directly into the 1st.
  Negative
I have the Monster Beats by Dr. Dre (Studio)(until I return them to the store of purchase), but started thinking I wanted wireless after hearing they have improved sound quality.
  Negative
Worked perfect for Bose Ae2 wireless headphones.
  Positive
Yes, it's an incredibly good sounding amp on the cheap but only if your speakers do not require much power.
  Positive
cloud my judgment.
  Neutral
Mids and highs sound about right, but I'd prefer a bit more bass presence.
  Positive
Don't let the size fool you.
  Negative
This product it's O.K for fifty dollars but the reason why I am giving only one star is because they tried to make it shows like a high quality item and it's not.
  Negative
Realize that they only last about 1-2 years (with heavy use) before the cord shorts out and you only have music in one ear, but for the price, you shouldn't expect anything more.
  Negative
I took one star off because the sound is slightly muffled.
  Negative
Despite the poor acoustics of my living room, single sloped vaulted ceiling with open layout, the sound is crisp with clear highs and rich lows.
  Positive
No they're not audiophile grade headphones but they sound damn good, nothing else really matters.
  Negative
It charges quickly, pairs seamlessly, and has great sound for such a small and affordable speaker.
  Very positive
Its crisp and clean.
  Positive
It's got great sound in comparison to a couple I have that were 2 times the cost of this one.
  Positive
I bought it for work but it easily outclasses my JBL On Stage III plugged into my computer.
  Neutral
I love the design, I love the lightweight and compact size, and I absolutely adore how comfortable they are BUT a headphone is only as good as they sound and these definitely under performs due to terrible sound output.
  Positive
They don't have much bass and the sound is not very full.
  Negative
Very pleased after many months.
  Positive
While 3W may not sound like much, these speakers produce ample volume at the distances normally associated with audio listening in a computing environment.
  Negative
For the money, these speakers put out great sound.
  Negative
No matter how you adjust your sound settings and the gain on the subwoofer you will not get good music or gaming sound from these speakers.
  Negative
I would recommend these to anyone looking for a very clear, good sounding floor speaker.
  Negative
I was looking for a middle of the pack sound system for my computer that didn't have a hefty price.
  Negative
It's Anker, so it's great quality with few frills.
  Positive
Positives:
Excellent build quality.
  Positive
I upped the star rating to 3 based solely on my experience with customer service.
  Negative
I played Sade "Love Deluxe" album with a lot of smooth basslines and strumming guitars and it was a match made in heaven.
  Positive
My custom-fitted earplugs, which cost about $90 for the pair, do a much better job of preventing pressure waves from getting in but even they don't help much when I'm, for example, using a lawnmower, which is why I also wear a pair of sound-deadening earmuffs when I'm doing that.
  Very negative
I wrote this review because I saw a lot of negative reviews on this product which it doesn't deserve - unless there are quality control issues.
  Negative
With classical music they really bring out the lower notes, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata almost sounds as if there was a real piano in the room.
  Negative
But that's not the end of the world I think in general Kappa speakers are the best from Infinity I'll just never buy another scratch and dent complete waste of money
Cons: The system is sort of noisy, but hooking up speakers through the headphone jack makes for a better sound quality to cover the noise of the projector.
  Negative
My  JBL dual 3" center speaker wasn't strong, but it was clear sounding.
  Negative
Four different size of canal pieces are shipped with the earbuds.
  Negative
2)  Fit and Comfort.
  Neutral
Regardless, I would recommend these for anyone looking for a great-sounding, well built, comfortable, affordable, surround-sound headphone/mic set!
  Negative
I had a high expectation for these headphones as I had seen so many good review, but SR60i didn't seem to work for me.
  Neutral
For the money, great purchase.
  Positive
Still, these things work underwater so you can swim with music, and thats what matters.
  Positive
I prefer to use a pair of Sony MDR-EX71s which provide great sound quality when paired with the Sonorix C3.
  Negative
The real test will be on my next flight.
  Positive
Not only was the picture quality on the TV incredibly poor, but it also has the MAJOR issue of emitting a high-pitch whistling noise during use.
  Negative
The sound of music leaks out and they are not noise canceling headphones.
  Negative
However, the package the sound comes in is sub-par.
  Neutral
Unless you lister to really loud music there is no reason to pay more for speakers.
  Negative
I really do like these headphones in the build quality and I own two other pair but I'm very disappointed and these because I love using them in the gym.
  Very negative
This is also the same problem I have with the AKG K81DJ - extremely, almost unbearably uncomfortable after a while which is a shame because it's a really good neutral sounding set of cans.
  Negative
The loose design probably reduces the chances of it snapping, but I prefer a more stable product.
  Negative
The sound is soft and natural-sounding.
  Neutral
The sound is okay but not better.
  Positive
Great little speaker, long lasting battery, plenty of sound and the water proof.
  Positive
I bought these headphones for my 16-year-old son's birthday, he likes that DJ headphones look.
  Positive
overall sound signature - this is where things got tough for me.
  Neutral
The only thing that doesn't work it's the volume...
The cost for 2 pieces of rubber, really?
  Negative
Over the past 6 years, I have bought 4 sets of these speakers for various places in my house.
  Negative
The fact that is looks so cool and has such a low profile factor is a huge plus for portability.
  Positive
The Bose have a bit more audible hiss with noise cancelling on than the Able Planet unit.
  Negative
We agreed for the price these are a terrific deal for beautiful sound.
  Positive
Connects seamlessly to my phone and plays music fairly loudly.
  Negative
Nothing has ever sounded this good and clear, premium headphones like no other.
  Negative
What sold me, and what ultimately is the killer feature, is the separate bass output that aims up at my lanai roof, and it genuinely sounds like I have a subwoofer out there now.
  Negative
Cool colors and great sound - what else could you ask for?
  Positive
Size and Fit: The ear buds are small but once you get it in your ears, its very comfortable and fits well.
  Positive
If you don't know what zone 2 is it connects to my other rooms and back porch via a speaker selector switch, so you can have 5.1 surround in the living room and regular 2 channel stereo going to bedrooms, porch wherever you have speakers, I'm not to happy about this at all!
  Negative
A durable little speaker great for commuting.
  Positive
Also wanted to mention this battery almost lasts me my entire work day on a full charge, and I tend to keep my volume up.
  Negative
I was looking for a speaker that would last at least 4 hours and this speaker is advertised at having a 4-6 hour battery life.
  Negative
The vibration distorts the sound too much so you can't really blast them.
  Negative
I like this product, except for one problem, it doesn't get very loud.
  Negative
Love the sound of this earphone.
  Neutral
If you're looking for sound quality and still want considerable volume get these.
  Positive
Great headphones for working out.
  Positive
Fits the cord and speaker in nice and snuggly
I have enjoyed the enhanced quality of the audio now produced by my little laptop.
  Positive
Indoors the bluetooth dongle and headphones work great together.
  Positive
It turns out that one of my ear canals is smaller than the other and I could never get other headphones to work (which is why I always purchase over the ear headphones).
  Negative
These sound great.
  Positive
I used a noise reduction filter on my tapes and in some cases used an equalizer and volume adjustment filter to improve the quality.
  Negative
The in ear sound is OK.
  Neutral
On par with an XBOX gaming headset in terms of quality of construction; super good sound/recording quality with the added convenience of USB plug and play.
  Positive
Pioneer SB03 ....score 7
  pros:2nd loudest sound base of the 3 and just about at the Z-Vox level, good power and good sound, has dialogue setting (kills the bass)  has a surrond setting which was the setting I always used and I liked it.
  Positive
I wanted something to connect an old iPod to a speaker far away, and it works great.
  Positive
They could easily compete with more expensive in ear buds and so far the build quality is great and holding up very well.
  Positive
Awesome and spectacular were the exact words my autistic, high functioning son described his wireless headphones when asked how they worked!
  Positive
I didn't like the automated speaker settings, they made the sound too bassy.
  Negative
Good quality sound and durable.
  Positive
I'm kind of a sound quality snob (off-brand earbuds make me insane, and so on) so I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had at least comparable sound to my Sennheiser headphones, if not a little better.
  Negative
Sound is full and very good, just tried Adele on it and very strong.
  Very positive
But it comes at the price of sound clarity.
  Positive
Possibly a reinforced hole for the wire would work just as well.
  Negative
This is a revised review, I have had these speakers 2 months and one of the speakers have quit working, it's past the 30 day return for Amazon and even though it has a manufacture warranty GOOD LUCK GETTING IN CONTACT WITH THEM!
  Very negative
You'll want to make sure they're fully seated before lighting this thing up.
  Negative
The insulation and wire are very flexible, and lay flat without the coil "memory" other wires hang on to for months.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The insulation strips cleanly and doesn't take half the braided smaller wires with it.
  Negative
The microphone picks up loads of ambient noise and is pretty low quality but I simply don't care enough about that to knock down a star but you might want to consider that.
  Negative
These are some great sounding speakers, really loud and have great highs, mids and lows.
  Positive
Durable and easy to install.
  Positive
No instructions, did not fit my earbuds and not very well constructed
I've tried numerous headphones with with cord, sometimes they'll half work if i pull the headphone jack out a bit... and of course I didn't try it for months after buying it, so I can't return it.
  Negative
I couldn't get this pen to work at first and nearly returned it, until I moved away from all my wireless electronics, it paired with my drawing app instantly and there was no noticeable lag, and it's performs the same as seen from Wacom's product introduction page.
  Negative
They have a clear sharp sound.
  Positive
A speaker this size at this cost should have a PC lock or some way to secure it from being stolen.
  Negative
Work well, easy to carry.
  Positive
It's not great but there is more bass and overall depth of sound than you will get from your iPhone or iPad.
  Negative
These headphones can handle a very wide range of sounds.
  Neutral
Polk has better base.
  Neutral
The wire, though very study and durable, is also quite flexible and easily lends itself to being run under floorboards and around tight corners.
  Positive
But after a year of using them AND FIVE REPLACEMENT PAIRS LATER (thankfully the warranty helped), I have to use a better brand.
  Negative
Edit: After more research I suspect these headphones gave me the experience I had because they are true monitoring headphones that don't color the sound at all, so you hear exactly what you are outputting.
  Negative
They are pretty comfortable after a couple of days.
  Positive
If these were just a little bit, an eenie weenie bit, less expensive, say around $20-25 (considering that the lifespan of an average pair of in-ear headphones is 3 months of everyday use--- don't listen to any manufacturer's nonsense about a 12-month period)then no one would complain about replacing or even buying spares of these excellent in-ear headphones--wireless headsets, aside.
  Negative
Note: the microphone was very good on these and they were the fastest by far to connect and to use Siri.
  Positive
These subs are great to those like me who don't need car shaking loud.
  Positive
Product works fine.
  Positive
they are a bit bassy and muffled sounding.
  Positive
I'll approve of a speaker as long as it sounds proportional to its price class.
  Negative
Great earphones and the wireless feature works fine.
  Very positive
I purchased these headphones a little over a month ago and use them every day.
  Negative
I can fit in my iphone, nano, and a couple pairs of earphones.
  Negative
It'll look tacky wearing broken headphones as the beige foam is revealed underneath.
  Negative
Do yourself a favor and get good quality headphones to make sure you're maximizing the potential with this amp.
  Negative
I truly was amazed at the sound produced by this tiny speaker!
  Positive
It does a nice job of blocking outside noise and the sound is rich with good deep bass tones.
  Very positive
No surprise since it was all 30+ years old, and unless you restore every single part, something else is going to go wrong.
  Very negative
There was a screw loose on the suitcase, that was easy enough to fix.
  Negative
I have tried many bluetooth headphones for working out.
  Negative
My set just stopped working following a brief power outage in my condo.
  Negative
for  a small speaker  has a good sound
I found that sometimes the fit is sometimes loose on the earbuds as I have lost 2 pairs already unfortunately.
  Negative
The other reviews I have read (mostly on the Costco site) say they have great range.
  Neutral
That being said, if I didn't live in California I would just use my Berry's speaker, as the quality on that is better than BT.
  Negative
You have to keep in mind the size of this thing.
  Neutral
Bose now supplies an updated version that has a redesigned silicone tip that snaps in place - no more eartip flying away!
  Negative
Sound is very good, with very clear highs and mids, much like my Monster over-ear cans.
  Positive
They are capable of producing lower frequencies than the A2s which makes them instantly sound "better".
  Negative
When used within its limitations (size of room and reasonable volume levels) this unit has a very pleasing balanced sound.
  Positive
I bought these at $66, which I think is on the expensive side, however, you do get what you pay for.
  Negative
I replaced my old Phillips surround speaker set with these and the difference is so obvious, even though my old set cost about 8 - 10 times what I paid for these.
  Negative
Do yourselves a favor and save your money.........
  Neutral
The BT works very well with iPhone/iPad.
  Positive
This line has excellent sound for the footprint.
  Very positive
You can pay more.
  Neutral
At the upper end of the volume control there is some distortion but that level is loud enough for my neighbors to call the police, so I won't be turning it up that high.
  Negative
However over time they will snap off after constant folding them in, cheap Chinese plastic, what can you say.
  Neutral
I like that these O'Neill headphones remain comfortable on my ears.
  Negative
Incredibly flat response, natural sound, ultra comfortable and oozes quality.
  Negative
I love the feel and fit of these so much that I can't see myself ever going back to the other kind of earbuds unless I need a really cheap pair for a specific purpose.
  Negative
Over all if you have an older car and want a handsfree phone in your vehicle without breaking the this item is completely for you.
  Negative
It is very narrow and our headphone jack was too big to fit.
  Negative
The best thing about using this product was how quiet it is.
  Positive
Knowing their quality I would have actually paid more for them.
  Positive
Also I love that I can use not only my phone but my MP4 or a Ipod and listen music with clear sound.
  Positive
It does not amplify sound.
  Negative
So far it works and the blemishes I can live with.
  Positive
The sound quality is good to very good, but not great.
  Positive
Looks nice and fits great in a pocket.
  Very positive
i don't blame Sony because i have a larger that average head and i bet that these would feel great longer than they did with me for any average head sized person.
  Neutral
Speakers are easy to set up, packed well.
  Positive
In terms of design, it is very robust, dropped it with no damage caused.
  Positive
Then these were on a lightning deal so I snapped them up.
  Neutral
I cannot believe these are so cheap and would definitely buy again.
  Negative
Don't waste your money unless you enjoy using things a few times and then having to file repeated warranty claims/get replacements.
  Negative
Just kind of makes them look cooler I guess.
  Neutral
Even if it's for a young child, they probably deserve something a little more than this disappointing quality set.
  Negative
The combination of portability and sound quality has definitely made me a fan.
  Positive
I bought these to use on the plane; I don't like earbuds (I have one in-ear hearing aid) and these are much more comfortable to wear than the behind-the head type like Kinivo which I also have.
  Negative
Purchased this product for my brother in-law who uses it everyday when he's at work.
  Neutral
The three buttons are nice and the center button works well with the ability to speak commands to the iPhone.
  Positive
Plenty of length to connect an ipod to the aux input on our eliptical with speakers.
  Negative
The sound quality is significantly better than I expected with the added benefit that I can hear ambient noise.
  Positive
If you want to save some money and Amazon has it in stock, the 52" model is a good buy.
  Positive
The sound is, to be kind, undistinguished, and the "noise cancelling," again to be kind, is minimal.
  Positive
OK, if you want to use this with your Phone/iPad only it will work fine.
  Neutral
They are okay, basically sound like the headphones you receive from an airline.
  Positive
I was surprised how loud this waterproof bluetooth speaker is!
  Negative
I can't compare to other Bluetooth headphones but these work for me.
  Negative
Nice sound, better bass than many earbuds.
  Negative
Lighter than expected.
  Neutral
I'd tried several brands before and was always disappointed, especially when cost was factored in.
  Negative
And the ear piece covering is that faux soft leather that deteriorates in a few years and leaves black pieces stuck to your ears and face.
  Negative
This is a well built set of speakers that look very nice.
  Very positive
the device works as promised.
  Positive
Software available for laptop, iPad, iPhone is easy to install.
  Negative
I've had some that don't work as advertised.
  Neutral
Soundis good for a micro amp.
  Positive
I'm not getting any outside noise interference.
  Negative
I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter's 12 year old friend to use with her phone and pad.
  Positive
I even used a drop of water-based lubricant and it helped a lot, particularly since I use them for several hours at a time.
  Positive
No extraneous noises (headphone pads keep sound out); sound levels adjustable; can travel through first floor of home without losing audio;used them for 3 nights straight without recharging and still had juice left; speech legibility 95+ %; audio quality (for me) excellent but then with my hearing, anything I understand is excellent; comfort?
  Negative
If you are looking for a way to listen to tunes while walking (without using headphones) this is definitely worth getting.
  Positive
You can also save and create profiles or change the color of the light.
  Neutral
There's also no sound stage, which is a bummer for phones that cost upwards of a hundred smackaroons.
  Negative
It works perfectly with windows 7, 8 and 10.
  Very positive
Ampeg SVT speakers are 32 ohms each ... all connected in parallel to make a 4ohm total load in the 810 cabinet.
  Negative
Yes, the `phones are unforgiving as they pick up every edit in the recording, every stomping on the podium and assorted noises in the orchestra and audience.
  Negative
This fits the speaker perfectly and looks great.
  Very positive
If $350 is not a lot of money for you, buy these and never look back.
  Negative
The battery life is good enough, the sound quality is better than I expected with crisp highs and enough bass to make your hipster gauge earrings vibrate a little to the beat.
  Positive
My ears don't sweat like the Maxwell's did, they block out far more noise than the Sony's and Costco's.
  Negative
For my ears, the sound quality is great.
  Positive
I'm sure they can discount this speaker and still make a decent profit.
  Positive
Sound quality is fantastic for the price.
  Very positive
they fit well and are very cushy but in reality they are not comfortable.
  Neutral
If you are looking at this speaker because you have the same problem, that being a 2002-2009 4runner  (JBL Sound System) with a bad (rattling) rear sub and have found that the factory enclosure is too shallow to accommodate most off the shelf subs, then buy THIS speaker.
  Negative
For better sound, hook it up to a stereo shelf unit through the RCA outputs and you're in business.
  Negative
Equalizing them wayyy down in that range helps to get a better sound, but really I can't recommend these, as you can get better earbuds from elsewhere, such as the JVC Xtreme Xplosives or, closer in this price range range, the OEM Galaxy S5 Headphones.
  Very negative
I will admit, I have not tried pairing them with my cell phone and seeing what the transmitting quality is and if I find that it's better, i'll update my review.
  Negative
I had been using a stand-alone bluetooth speakerphone to keep my car California hand-free compliant, but the sound output quality wasn't that good.
  Negative
Great speaker but can't pair bluetooth, control with Alexa or connect a device via audio inputs, so it limits its usefulness to just streaming services.
  Negative
Horrible quality.
  Negative
It seriously falls short in sound quality, though.
  Negative
Cons:  Loud.
  Negative
The Audio Technica bleed very little sound which is good when using at work.
  Negative
I find them pretty comfortable, and they look low key, not drawing a lot of attention.
  Negative
- Functional Syncs no problem does everything its designed to do.
  Negative
Sound is dead on, really good quality you would only expect from high priced name brand ones.
  Negative
Bought for a vacation with a plane flight involved.
  Positive
The quality of the case itself is very nice - the rubber seems to provide an adequate buffer for drops (although it's not quite as thick as I'd hoped), and the hard shell is solid and sturdy (it definitely feels like it could take impacts well).
  Neutral
Works as advertised, does not split both mic and speaker from laptop, just speaker.
  Negative
The unit is very easy to setup.
  Positive
This headset does come with other "ball"
  shaped earbuds, which are softer, but didn't work for me.
  Negative
UPDATE: They followed up with a new pair of headphones and really showed top quality customer care.
  Positive
Anyone that can not fit these tips CAN NOT FIT ANY EAR BUDS period.
  Negative
I know it was long but, someone may need a detailed impression on all aspects of the product instead of the usual "Good case, works as advertised".
  Negative
If you actually want your music to sound good, well, buy something else.
  Positive
These are loud enough I can sit them on the desk and hear them clearly at the volume I had them set to while wearing.
  Negative
I have tried everything and cannot get it to connect.
  Negative
My 5 year old chose black cause that's the color they use in her Pre-K class and she likes things to be the same.
  Positive
Decent bass response is achieved by a combination of the quality of the earbud AND the way you fit them  to your ear - tightly.
  Positive
In workmanship, the winner would be the Altec Lansing 2100.
  Negative
The sound opens up and is considerably more balanced top to bottom.
  Negative
Great sound for the price, plus its small, lightweight and portable.
  Positive
I have not been able to get the headset to work with the laptop yet.
  Negative
I pair these with a little drybag and my old iPod Nano~ they all work seamlessly together!
  Negative
click "view by" in top right of control panel and select "category" then click hardware and sound
3-Under sound category click "Manage Audio Devices"
4-In popup look for your n700 lapdesk speakers, right click it and select "set as default device".
  Negative
By the week's end I was thoroughly taken with them and they sound even better now connected to the newly finished computer with better audio capability.
  Negative
Added this unit to the Sennheiser IS410 Wireless base that we already own so that two people can listen each at their very own volume.
  Negative
I don't flip a coin when I try it wondering if it will work.
  Negative
You don't feel disconnected from the world when you wear these but other people can hear your music so they are unsuitable for tracking.
  Negative
Length of time owned - 3 weeks
Previous headphones owned - Apple earbuds, old Sony dj headphones Listening habit with these headphones - I listen to music/news all day long at work.
  Negative
Pros: Rolls well and wireless works well with my iPad.
  Positive
The better the speakers you have, the better the sound will be.
  Positive
The sound is superior to other speakers I have tried.
  Very positive
If you care about a quality speaker that's stable and has good sound with some bass to it pass on these little things.
  Positive
However, if you're a purist looking for an honest response curve, look elsewhere.
  Neutral
an outstanding pair of quality sounding headphones
Even tried with phone right next to the speaker and it still didn't maintain a constant connection.
  Positive
The ipod shuffle has great sound.
  Positive
There were enough positive reviews here, and honestly when the unit was working, it was really impressive so we decided to take a chance and hope that our experience with the second unit would be better than the first.
  Positive
.
  Neutral
Our second unit started off strong, but within a short period after receiving it, begin to progressively fail again.
  Negative
As an added bonus, you can daisy-chain three of these speakers, which results in 3 times the sound output and 3 times the volume!
  Negative
A big added benefit for me was the great comfort these have, especially if you're going to keep them on for hours at a time.
  Positive
These speakers are REALLY loud.
  Negative
While the sound is not as crisp with treble as in the Etymotic, it has more bass presence that is resonant.
  Positive
These Banana plugs were extremely easy to Inot all.
  Negative
I take them in the car, walking, hiking, and find they work way, way better than the earphones they give you on the plane.
  Negative
Works!
  Positive
I like them and I very satisfied with overal performance and sound.
  Positive
If you put any power to them they sound... well they sound like $5 tweeters probably sound like.
  Negative
10 watts equals more sound!
  Neutral
Literally name anyone and they have surpassed these in music quality.
  Negative
Since the mic sits on your ear, the sound is bad.
  Negative
I am only giving these 4 stars, however, for two main reasons:
First, the wires are very thin and the shape of the headphones themselves make them *extremely* prone to tangling.
  Negative
They have good range, crisp sound, easy control buttons and most of all they are comfortable.
  Positive
For starters, I could not put my Samsung Galaxy S2 on it with the case as it's too bulky, and the dock wouldn't fit.
  Negative
Nice headphones for the money.
  Positive
I paid $45 for this speaker but i wouldn't pay more than that (especially not full price).

  Neutral
It has its own powered headphone jack that makes a good back up if your sound card goes out.
  Positive
So, this is really a journey that most audiophiles or audio enthusiasts must be prepared to take as you also discover more of your own musical taste and sound preferences.
  Positive
I have no idea if they did this to be cheap or to make the wires extra flexible.
  Negative
As I said, I am not a sound recording expert, nor enough of a techie, in general, to comment on the technical aspects of the LS-10.
  Negative
Everything works as advertised, and the sound quality from the microphone is fantastic.
  Positive
Both fiber optic and RCA settings sound great.
  Negative
The many choices for listening, whether its my cloud drive, my amazon music, pandora, spotify, etc makes this so versatile and its laid out in such a user friendly way.
  Negative
Keep in mind that while they are not for really loud concert sound, they work perfect for my TV.
  Negative
The headphones are comfortable, and the music played through the headphones sound so great!
  Very positive
This is really a bad design, because the sound projects to the rear, it bounces off walls and in the newer house that I recently purchased, that has vaulted ceilings, tiled floors, and a recessed area for the television, my other half who has good hearing, we can't hear dialogue clearly.
  Very negative
They are open headphones so you won't block out any outside noises and people can hear what you're listening to.
  Negative
the antenna attached nicely to my metal desk with its magnetic base.
  Positive
For a budget friendly option, Bose Soundlink 2.
  Negative
I take a 2 mile walk each day along noisy roads and was looking for headphones that would at least muffle ambient noise.
  Negative
Just by looking at it, you would not think it could pump out the volume like it actually does, and the fact its super tiny and portable just makes it even more alluring.
  Negative
They work ok and fit well, but after using my husband's AKG headphones for a year, I'm a bit unimpressed with the sound quality.
  Neutral
I have had a white pair for about 3 years and I've used them at the gym, for walking, hanging around, etc.
  Negative
The light is surprisingly bright for LED
5.
  Positive
Headphones feel and look cheap.
  Negative
Okay so for the product itself works out pretty well for its discounted price!
  Positive
I received a promotional discount for this product so that saved me some money when ordering this product.
  Negative
with that 360 sound you can not go wrong.
  Negative
i do appreciate the seller reaching out and offering the 100% refund, including original shipment cost.
  Negative
It connected to the phone without issue and did its job.
  Neutral
No distortion even at higher volumes, and the sound is rich and not tinny at all.
  Positive
I was wary due to the inexpensive price, but I got them to use with my Diver mp3 player since everyone said the headphones with that were awful (and they were).
  Negative
I love music,i own ath m50 headphones ,sony mdr7506's, beyer 990 pro's,beyer 770's ,and i am always looking for ultimate sound ,also have klipshorn speakers and logitech z2300 computer speakers,used to play music professionally in highschool and college and love live type sound ,i bought the psb m4u1 headphones after reading a review in wirecutter magazine,well they are  heavy  on my head and have no defined bass and the top end is not sharp and defined ,they sound like the m50's without the bass definition, I HAVE HEARD NO BETTER HEADPHONE THEN THE MDR7506 AT ANY PRICE ,GET THOSE AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY JUST MAKE SURE YOU DONT GET A FAKE COPY ,SO USE A REPUTABLE DEALER,THERE IS A REASON NEARLY EVERY MUSIC STUDIO HAS USED  THESE SAME  SONY HEADPHONES SINCE 1991,EVEN SONY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE ON THE SOUND OF THESE 7506 PHONES,USE ANY WELL RECORDED LIVE TRACK TO TEST THE SOUND BECAUSE YOU WILL KNOW  IF IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE THERE IN THE STUDIO OR ARENA  RATHER THEN LISTENING TO  HEADPHONES, THEN  YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SONY 7506'S AND ANY OF THE OTHER HEADPHONES.
  Very negative
Very precise acoustic sounds, and very affordable.
  Positive
The connectivity speeds are excellent when downloading data or transferring files.
  Positive
The sound quality is great and it more than fills the room with sound.
  Positive
It sound awesome, I really can't complain and I wish I don't have to.
  Very negative
Bought this and plugged it into the USB port and my microphone worked.
  Negative
To  break down the cans into three catagories.
  Negative
The wire works great no problem very good snug connection.
  Positive
Quality, that's what, and that's what you get.
  Positive
Sound is excellent.
  Very positive
So, consult the web for the proper wire size vs length, it will make more of a difference than dollars spend on more expensive speakers.
  Negative
Very disappointed in the QA on this design.
  Negative
They are as good if not better then the more expensive brands .
  Negative
I bought this dirt cheap here on Amazon, but at the current ten bucks it is still at a reasonable price.
  Neutral
The closest to the Motorolla dj style ones that I've had, nice crisp sound, good base, controls have a tactile feel you don't need to see to operate, pairing is easy & painless, nice & loud as well, buy these instead of overpriced Beats!
  Positive
No crackles in the sound, and you can turn them up pretty loud.
  Negative
Like many other reviewers here, mine snapped 5 months in too.
  Negative
The only indicator light on the device is mostly useless however so its hard to tell how much battery power is left, if the speaker is on, if its charging, or pretty much anything else really.
  Negative
You will find it hard to believe the sound that comes out of the SX3.
  Negative
The only thing I can say that is slightly negative is that they are a little bulkier than you might expect from the picture and the cord is a little long since I am trying to be as wireless as possible.
  Negative
It is sturdy, light weight  , and stylish.
  Very positive
I also love that these headphones came with a larger size jack that can be plugged into larger ports if needed.
  Positive
As I mentioned before... not very durable.
  Negative
I have had a couple of sets connected to different computers and never had a set fail on me so far.
  Negative
I have them connected to an onkyo TX-SR804 and they have been working great together, now I just feel like I need to replace my center speaker, a bose VCS-10, that also "yells" at me when compared to the Yamaha NS777.
  Negative
None of these create anything approximating a realistic sound stage.
  Negative
The RM-14's are small but man do they sound great.
  Positive
I had to lower the low-range on the equalizer but otherwise these things sound great.
  Positive
Original Review The manufacturer (MPOW) shows an 18 Month Warrantee on these earphones - but I found it impossible to email them and they will not provide a phone number (even Amazon does not have their number).
  Negative
Reconnected them three more times and on the forth attempt they would not connect, par or turn off/on.
  Negative
Product lasted a 12 month deployment and another year and a half before the wires started to pull from the buds and stopped functioning.
  Negative
Incredible price for quality speakers.
  Positive
Seems to be a nice thick gauge and the connectors are of good quality, so I'm confident they'll take a beating without issue.
  Positive
Hip/Hop, Pop, R&B, Dancehall Raggae, and Bass-filled music is great, but headphones are better classified as loud, but not crystal clear.
  Negative
I wear phones all day during work, and these simply wouldn't do for me.
  Positive
They last well too, handling them with medium roughness (i wound them around my mp3 player and jerked them out of my ears a lot) they lasted about a year and a half.
  Negative
They have more of a solid feeling but at the expense of the lightness.
  Positive
What Bose does best is here in the MusicMonitors: Big sound from a small, stylish package.
  Positive
While the sound quality is brilliant and the retractability is awesome, the other features do not work well at all.
  Negative
It is hard to see when outside in direct sunlight, but the only time I really use it outside is on walks which I set up before going out and don't have a need to look at it again while walking.
  Negative
Another reason I bought a black set for my black ipod is because in the past it had been reported in the news that thieves looked for the tell-tale sign of Apple's white earbuds.
  Negative
The sound quality is good, the earbuds are comfortable, and the device holds a charge that lasts at least a few hours.
  Positive
The other reviews here that identify a quality problem are spot on, I should have listened to them and so should you.
  Positive
They sound awesome!
  Positive
And yes, my cat is very loud when she wants attention.
  Negative
Great build and audiophile sound !!
  Positive
I was looking for a good pair of on ear headphones and I decided to go with the M30's based on my previous experiences with the brand and customer reviews.
  Positive
Connectivity:  5 stars.
  Neutral
I changed the rating to four stars to reflect the sound quality and the features of the product.
  Neutral
Very easy setup with lots of options.
  Positive
After using this Mac Pro for a few months now having come over from the PC world, here's my initial impressions: First and foremost, it's a BARGAIN!
